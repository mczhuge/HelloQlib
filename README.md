## Introduction
I'm interested in program-based quantitative investing for a while. 
This is a project that I tried out with the **[Qlib](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib)** library, and it performs stock prediction experiments.
The goal is to make a model that is better than the standard transformer and its variants.
I made some attempts by introducing Probmask, TokenEmbedding inspired by **[Informer](https://github.com/zhouhaoyi/Informer2020)** that is popular to model long sequences. So I called the model "Simplified Informer". Besides, I use MAE loss to train the model. 

## Install
* Create a conda container.
    ```bash
    conda create -n qlib_env python=3.7
    conda activate qlib_env
    pip install numpy
    pip install --upgrade  cython   
    conda install pytorch    
    ```
* Clone the repository and install ``Qlib`` as follows.
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:mczhuge/HelloQlib.git && cd HelloQlib/qlib
    pip install .
    ```

* Load and prepare data by running the following code:
  ```bash
  # get 1d data
  python scripts/get_data.py qlib_data --target_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data --region cn
  # get 1min data
  python scripts/get_data.py qlib_data --target_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data_1min --region cn --interval 1min
  ```

As mentioned in Qlib, this dataset is created by public data collected by [crawler scripts](scripts/data_collector/), which have been released in
the same repository.


## Experiments
Qlib provides a tool named `qrun` to run the whole workflow automatically (including building dataset, training models, backtest and evaluation). You can start an auto quant research workflow and have a graphical reports analysis according to the following steps: 

1. Quant Research Workflow: Run  `qrun` with lightgbm workflow config ([workflow_config_informer_Alpha158.yaml](qlib/examples/benchmarks/Informer/workflow_config_informer_Alpha158.yaml) as following.
    ```bash
      cd examples  # Avoid running program under the directory contains `qlib`
      qrun benchmarks/Informer/workflow_config_informer_Alpha158.yaml
    ```
    The result of `qrun` is as follows, please refer to [Intraday Trading](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more details about the result. 

    ```bash
    'The following are analysis results of the excess return without cost(1day).'
                       risk
    mean               0.000489
    std                0.004326
    annualized_return  0.116330
    information_ratio  1.743127
    max_drawdown      -0.079772
    'The following are analysis results of the excess return with cost(1day).'
                         risk
    mean               0.000303
    std                0.004325
    annualized_return  0.072150
    information_ratio  1.081228
    max_drawdown      -0.088342
    ```
    Here are detailed documents for `qrun` and [workflow](https://qlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component/workflow.html).
